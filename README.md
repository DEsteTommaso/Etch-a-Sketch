# Sketchpad/Etch-A-Sketch Project - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Introduction

In this project, I built a browser-based sketchpad, similar to an Etch-A-Sketch, to practice my DOM manipulation skills. The goal was to create an interactive grid where users can "draw" by hovering over squares, with the added challenge of dynamically generating the grid using JavaScript.

## Assignment Overview

1. **Grid Creation**: I generated a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript, placing them inside a container div. I used Flexbox to align the squares into a grid layout.

2. **Hover Effect**: I implemented a hover effect so that the grid squares change color as the mouse passes over them, leaving a trail like a pen.

3. **Dynamic Grid Resizing**: I added a button that prompts the user for a new grid size (up to 100x100). Upon input, the old grid is cleared, and a new grid is generated within the same dimensions.
